# Pollite

Frontend website for the Pollite webapp.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Deploying

NOTE: before deploying, make sure to copy `src/environments/environment.prod.EXAMPLE.ts` to a file
in the same directory, without the `.example` part. In this file, fill in the `serverEndpoint`
property to be the address of the Pollite server.
